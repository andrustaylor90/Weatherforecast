### Write an HTTP server that serves the forecasted weather. Your server should expose an endpoint that:

- Accepts latitude and longitude coordinates
- Returns the short forecast for that area for Today (“Partly Cloudy” etc)
- Returns a characterization of whether the temperature is “hot”, “cold”, or “moderate” (use your discretion on mapping temperatures to each type)
- Use the National Weather Service API Web Service as a data source.
 

### The purpose of this exercise is to provide a sample of your work that we can discuss together in the Technical Interview.

- We respect your time. Spend as long as you need, but we intend it to take around an hour.
- We do not expect a production-ready service, but you might want to comment on your shortcuts.
- The submitted project should build and have brief instructions so we can verify that it works.
- You may write in whatever language or stack you’re most comfortable in, but it’s recommended to use the language for the job you’re applying for.
